        <h1 class="section-title">How it is spread</h1>
        <p class="inset">Coronavirus is a respiratory illness that is spread from person to person. 
            It is spread through respiratory droplets including saliva, coughs, and sneezes.This is the most common transmission. When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, droplets or tiny particles called aerosols carry the virus into the air from their nose or mouth. Anyone who is within 6 feet of that person can breathe it into their lungsCurrent evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, for example at a conversational distance. The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range
            The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance </p>

            <h1 class="section-title">who is at risks</h1>
            <p class="double">Anyone can contract COVID-19, Those who are at higher risk of contracting the virus are those who work directly with 
                those who are sick (healthcare workers). People who live in an area that has an on-going spread of the coronavirus are also at riskBut it most commonly affects middle-aged and older adults. The risk of developing dangerous symptoms increases with age, with those who are age 85 and older are at the highest risk of serious symptoms.
                People of any age can catch COVID-19. But it most commonly affects middle-aged and older adults. The risk of developing dangerous symptoms increases with age, with those who are age 85 and older are at the highest risk of serious symptoms. In the U.S., about 81% of deaths from the disease have been in people age 65 and older. Risks are even higher for older people when they have other health conditions.

                Take all your medications as prescribed. Consider developing a care plan that includes information about your medical conditions, medications, providers' names and emergency contacts.
                
                Nursing home residents are at high risk because they often have multiple health problems, combined with advanced age. And germs can spread very easily between people who live near each other. If you live in a nursing home, follow the guidelines to prevent infection. Ask about protection measures for residents and visitor restrictions. Let staff know if you feel ill.
                
                Older people are also more likely to have Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's can make it more difficult for them to remember the precautions recommended to prevent infection.
                he virus can also spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes. But the risk is low.

                The COVID-19 virus can spread from someone who is infected but has no symptoms. This is called asymptomatic transmission. The COVID-19 virus can also spread from someone who is infected but hasn't developed symptoms yet. This is called presymptomatic transmission.
                
                It's possible to get COVID-19 more than once.
                
                When a virus has one or more new mutations it’s called a variant of the original virus. The omicron (B.1.1.529) variant spreads more easily than the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the delta variant. However, omicron appears to cause less severe disease. People who are fully vaccinated can get breakthrough infections and spread the virus to others. But the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness. This variant also reduces the effectiveness of some monoclonal antibody treatments. Omicron has a few major offshoots (sublineages), including BA.5 and BA.2.12.1. BA.5 made up about 88% of COVID-19 infections that had genetic sequencing in the india in August, 2022, according to the CDC.
                
                In April, the CDC downgraded the delta variant from a variant of concern to a variant being monitored. This means that the delta variant isn’t currently considered a major public health threat in the world</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">effect of Covid-19</h1>
            <p class="double">National COVID-19 will most likely affect the economy through supply, chains, demand, and financial markets, affecting business investment. household consumption, and international trade Global The economy has practically ground to a halt. Bloomberg Economics estimates that GDP growth in the first quarter of 2020 has slowed to 12% year on year-weakest on record
                The virus moves down your respiratory tract. That’s the airway that includes your mouth, nose, throat, and lungs. Your lower airways have more ACE2 receptors than the rest of your respiratory tract. So COVID-19 is more likely to go deeper than viruses like the common cold.

Your lungs might become inflamed, making it tough for you to breathe. This can lead to pneumonia, an infection of the tiny air sacs (called alveoli) inside your lungs where your blood exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide.

If your doctor does a CT scan of your chest, they’ll probably see shadows or patchy areas called “ground-glass opacity.”

            <h1 class="section-title">social distancing</h1>
            <p class="double">COVID-19 is easily spread to those who are within close proximity to each other to practice groups and or least 6 feet apart do not gather in large groups, and avoid This gatherings or crowds. Experts agree that the COVID-19 Cough outbreak cannot be stopped but implementing social distancing and reducing community contact has proven to be highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve
                In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others (the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time) and avoiding gathering together in large groups.

By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths. The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing. To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of mass gatherings. Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.

Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact (coughing or sneezing), direct physical contact (including sexual contact), indirect physical contact (such as by touching a contaminated surface), and airborne transmission (if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods). The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects. Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2 m (6 ft) in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.

            <p class="double">Perform strict hand washing and respiratory hygiene.

                • Apply masks to suspect patients; isolate when possible.
                
                • Tell patients to cover nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.
                
                • Perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions.
                
                • Don personal protective equipment (PPE) - mask, eye
                
                protection, gown & gloves.
                
                • Prevent needle-stick or sharps injury.
                
                • Ensure safe waste management, environmental cleaning and
                
                sterilization of equipment.
                The FDA has approved the Moderna vaccine, now called Spikevax, to prevent COVID-19 in people age 18 and older. The FDA has also authorized the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in children ages 6 months through 17 years old. The FDA has also authorized the Novavax COVID-19, adjuvanted vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in people age 12 and older.

                Due to the risk of a potentially life-threatening blood-clotting problem, the FDA is restricting use of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine to certain people age 18 and older. Examples include people who had a severe allergic reaction after getting an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and people who can't get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine due to limited access or personal or religious concerns. If you get this vaccine, be sure to understand the risks and symptoms of the blood-clotting problem.
                
                A vaccine can prevent you from getting the COVID-19 virus or prevent you from becoming seriously ill if you get the COVID-19 virus. In addition, COVID-19 vaccination might offer better protection than getting sick with COVID-19. A recent study showed that unvaccinated people who already had COVID-19 are more than twice as likely as fully vaccinated people to get reinfected with COVID-19.
                
                After getting vaccinated, you can more safely return to many activities you may not have been able to do because of the pandemic. However, if you are in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital and new COVID-19 cases, the CDC recommends wearing a mask indoors in public. You're considered fully vaccinated two weeks after you get a second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, after two doses of the Novavax vaccine, or two weeks after you get a single dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. You are considered up to date with your vaccines if you have gotten all recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including booster doses, when you become eligible.</p>
